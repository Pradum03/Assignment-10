    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It returns a file object that can be used to read, write, and manipulate the contents of the file. The open() function takes two arguments: the file path and the mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several modes for opening a file in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"r\" - read mode: This mode opens the file for reading (default mode). If the file does not exist, an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the close() function is used to close an opened file. It is important to close a file after you are done working with it because it releases the system resources that were being used by the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file in Python, the operating system allocates resources to the file, such as file buffers and file descriptors. If you do not close the file properly, these resources may remain allocated even after your program has finished executing. Over time, this can lead to resource leaks, which can cause your program to slow down or even crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file also ensures that any data that was buffered in memory is written to the file. If you do not close the file, the buffered data may not be written to the file, which means that any changes you made to the file will not be saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, some operating systems have limits on the number of files that can be opened at once by a process. If you open too many files without closing them, you may hit this limit, which can cause your program to fail."
